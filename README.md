# Google-Analysis-SEO
 
## Purpose
As a marketing analyst, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest trends and patterns. Using Google search analysis, we can determine which keywords are trending and assess if our marketing goals align with these trends. This project encompasses data retrieval, visualization, analysis, and concludes with a summary of findings and an invitation for engagement from readers.

## Topic Discussed:
- Data Retrieval
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Geographic Trends
- Time-Series Analysis
- Keyword Analysis
- Data Interpretation
- Business Insights
- Market Research
- Python Programming

## Tools
- Google Trends (via Pytrends)
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Process

### 1. Installation of Pytrends Library
Install the Pytrends library using the `pip install pytrends` command.

### 2. Importing Necessary Python Libraries
Import the required Python libraries, including pandas, Pytrends, and matplotlib.

### 3. Setting Up Pytrends Object
Create a Pytrends object using `trends = TrendReq()`.

### 4. Identifying Top Countries for a Specific Query
- Build a payload with a specific keyword (e.g., "Machine Learning") using `trends.build_payload(kw_list=["Machine Learning"])`.
- Retrieve data on the interest by region using `data = trends.interest_by_region()`.
- Sort the data to identify the top countries by search interest and select the top 10.

### 5. Data Visualization
Create a bar chart to visualize the search interest by country using `data.reset_index().plot()` and other plotting functions. This step visually represents the top countries with the most searches for the given keyword.

### 6. Time-Series Analysis of Search Trends
- Configure Pytrends object to capture time-series data by specifying parameters such as language (`hl`) and timezone (`tz`).
- Build a payload for the keyword "Machine Learning" using `data.build_payload(kw_list=['Machine Learning'])`.
- Retrieve and analyze the interest over time using `data = data.interest_over_time()`.
- Create a time-series plot to show the trend of search queries related to "Machine Learning" over time.

### Additional Insights
Through exploring the various Google Trends API methods, it was concluded that Algeria does not significantly consider keyword analysis in their projects. This is an important tool for understanding customer interests and should be incorporated more broadly.
